Using this API
--------------

This connector is autogenerated from [the spec](https://www.bitmex.com/explorer/resources). It is 
a work in progress, but it is usable with modification.

More documentation for this connector [is available from the Swagger project](https://github.com/wordnik/wordnik-python3).

Basic example
------------

Copy the python3 folder into your project as `bitmex` - for example:

```
--> projectRoot
  |
  |--> bot.py
  |--> bitmex
    |
    --> models
    --> swagger.py
    --> ...
```

`bot.py`

```python
from bitmex import *
apiUrl = 'https://www.bitmex.com/api/v1'
apiKey = 'ACCESS_TOKEN'
client = swagger.ApiClient(apiKey, apiUrl)

chatApi = ChatApi.ChatApi(client)
print(chatApi.chat_find())
```
