BitMEX API Connectors
=====================

A few simple connectors for connecting to the BitMEX API, which conforms to the
[Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md) spec.

Connectors in the `clients` and `servers` directories are autogenerated. Connectors in the `experimental` directory
are written by BitMEX employees to showcase various features.

See the `swagger.*` file in the root directory or src directory of each client to start.
